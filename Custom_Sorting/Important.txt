1. why toString Overriding method-
However, if you have a list of custom objects, as in your previous examples with the Person class,
 the default behavior of printing the list will call the toString method of those custom objects. 
 If the toString method is not overridden in the custom class, you will get the default behavior, 
 which includes the class name and hash code, as mentioned earlier.
